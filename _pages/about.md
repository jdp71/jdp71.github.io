I'm an experienced data scientist with an extensive background in data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

I have a PhD in physical/analytical chemistry from the University of Utah.  I will finish up my MS in data science from Bellevue University in May 2020.

I have over 20 years of experience working with, analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing all types of data.  Many of these activities have resulted in peer-reviewed publications.
