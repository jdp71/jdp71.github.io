We have a WIBS instrument that we are using at work for a particular test.  Unfortunately, we are no longer able to use the analysi software that came with the instrument.  Because of this, we had no way to look at the instrument data.  This Jupyter Notebook script makes it possible for us to use the recorded WIBS data.
